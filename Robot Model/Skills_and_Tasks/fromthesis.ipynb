    "B.1 Skills\n",
    "\n",
    "We tested the following skills in the Snap Circuits domain:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. LED – When an LED is required for the task.\n",
    "2. LED Directionality – Understanding which direction the LED should be facing within the circuit.\n",
    "3. LED Needs Resistor – When an LED is placed on the board, a resistor is needed.\n",
    "4. Resistor – How a resistor can be used to lower the light or music.\n",
    "5. Motor – When a motor should be used.\n",
    "6. Switch – When a switch should be used.\n",
    "7. Button – When a button should be used.\n",
    "8. Speaker – When a speaker should be used.\n",
    "9. MC – When a music circuit should be used.\n",
    "10. Connect – How to correctly connect two pieces together.\n",
    "11. Closed – A circuit must be closed, forming a complete loop from the positive side of the battery to the negative side.\n",
    "12. Power MC – How to connect the Music Circuit (MC) to power. The positive of the MC should be connected to the positive of the battery, and the negative of the MC should be connected to the negative of the battery.\n",
    "13. Signal MC – How to connect the positive of the battery to the signal of the MC (enables music to be played in a rhythm).\n",
    "14. Trigger MC – How to correctly connect the positive side of the battery to the Trigger input on the MC.\n",
    "15. Hold MC – How to correctly connect the positive side of the battery to the Hold input on the MC.\n",
    "16. AND Gate – How to create an AND gate using pieces. Used for tasks that require both a switch to be on and a button pressed for the circuit to work.\n",
    "17. OR Gate – How to create an OR gate using pieces. Used for tasks that require either a switch to be on or a button pressed for the circuit to work.\n",
